# Apply Recruitment Tools MCP (Public)

Lightweight MCP server that ships non-sensitive tooling (boolean search,
job posting generator, interview prompts). Build it locally:

```bash
cd apply-codes/mcp-server-public
npm install
npm run build
```

Then grab the ready-made agent snippets from `AGENT_SETUP.md` (generated via
`node scripts/mcp/generate-agent-docs.mjs`).
